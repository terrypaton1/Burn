# Burn
A small mobile game 'Burn' developed in Unity, based on a concept from 2011, by Terry Paton.
The sun has gone super nova, vaporising most of the solar system. Steer your ship through the rubble and dangers to escape.

Essentially a very simple game, a short dodge and survive game. The primary focus is on clean code, clean Unity setup and a finished product.
